    "In a world where advertising is becoming increasingly competetive, it is becoming also more and more important to target your audience accurately in order to ensure your business can continue to thrive.\n",
    "With the recent advancements in computing, machine learning algorithms are now largely available in a number of frameworks that makes it easy for everybody to train and use. Leveraging this new technology to target your customers accurately is nowadays paramount.\n",
    "Starbucks is a coffee company that was founded in 1971 in Seattle and despite his strong presence is the market, the recent pandemic hit the sector quite strongly. Starbucks reported his first quarterly loss in 7 years (source: https://www.ft.com/content/4c876c5a-a03a-3f57-8a04-c364b12ad4b7) and many bars and restaurants had to close down as their profitability was strongly undermined by the social distancing guidelines put in place by world governments."

    "\n",
    "1) EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis: In this stem we will analyse the distribution and correlations among the variables in the           dataset. This will give us a sense of what challenges we may face in modelling the data, and what variables might prove         useful for our model.\n",

    "2) Data Cleaning and formatting: We currently have 3 datasets and classic machine learning algorithms work with a single Matrix \n",
    "                                 or tabular data that contains the features and a target variable for our prediction.\n",

    "3) Feature Engineering/Selection: In this step we will create variables from the current datasets we have that we will then use                                   in the final model. We will also select the most relevant variables for our prediction and                                     retain those with the highest explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Data Modelling: In this step we will fit a number of machine learning algorithms and we will fine tune the parameters and                      select the best performing model against the measure we have chosen: Accuracy. The ML models we will employ \n",
